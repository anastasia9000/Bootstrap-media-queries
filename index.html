Start with this HTML code:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<body>
    <div class="container">
  <h1 class="introH"> You Gotta Love Pugs </h1>
  <img src="https://www.petmd.com/sites/default/files/Acute-Dog-Diarrhea-47066074.jpg" alt="cute pug dog" class="dog">
  <p class="introP">Dog lovers agree: they just can't get enough of the incredible breed known as pugs. They're the most "pugly" breed of them all, and they're all the better for it. They'll slobber all over you and you'll love it. In fact, many have said that a pug's saliva is 200% cleaner than the average human baby. When you're thinking of your next dog and you don't know what kind you want, consider taking on the love of a pug.</p>
  <button class="button1">Click on this if you love pugs</button>
  <button class="button2">Click on this if you DON'T love pugs</button>
    </div>
</body>
</html>


<!--Set a default font-size and image width in the CSS. Set one button to be on the left of the screen and one button on the right of the screen.

For each of the breakpoints 1224, 768, and 320pxâ€¦.
Use a different background color
Change the font size in a way that practices responsive design (smaller screen = slightly smaller font)
Decide when you want to hide the image. Does it show up on super-small screens, or is it too large to be displayed (and should be hidden instead)?
Choose to display the buttons vertically or horizontally, perhaps by modifying their margin or width.
